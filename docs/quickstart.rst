The ``Store`` object will initialize all data storage services listed in the ``secrets`` variable which is of type `ConfigParser <https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html>`__. One convenient option to manage the settings for data storage services is to store the values in ``.ini`` configuration files.

See section "`Configuration files <config_files.html>`__" for more information.
